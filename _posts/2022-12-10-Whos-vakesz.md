As you might already know my name and some small things from the About me page, I’m Gabor Pinkova, currently working at Continental Automotive. But it hasn’t been that easy for me to get to where I am. I was lucky that when I was a child I had the option to have some shitty computers without any internet connection. Some of them I still have saved up, which you can see in the below pictures. About the name “vakesz”, I don’t really remember mostly why it stuck to me, or where exactly it came from but I remember I was called “vaksi” a few times when I was small and maybe I created it due to that back then, cause this one sounded way cooler.

When I was small I learned to program in school and was interested in it already. I loved breaking down ideas into smaller parts and trying to find a way to solve them that way. That always satisfied me. Then later in time, I got to the university and it was just downright boring. I wasn’t feeling like I was learning anything new, therefore didn’t put much effort into it or care about it. After 1.5 years, I’ve left it without any regrets. I didn’t know at the time that it might hurt me in the future.

But, let’s jump to the present then. I’m currently working at my current job for almost 5 years. I do enjoy it, cause the people are quite awesome and helpful. Sure, there are a few who you gotta avoid but you learn that over time, and gladly, there are not many. Some customer projects are exhausting, or even mentors if you start as a new engineer anywhere, but I was lucky to have someone so talented as Zoltan P. and Attila H. They taught me a lot of things that I can appreciate highly. They were lazy, but also smart. They didn’t give me a right away solution 100% of the time, instead just told me to look around there or another place, trying to at least give me a starting point to look at. For some people it can be exhausting I understand but I loved to sit down and understand, what was actually happening at those parts where they directed me. That way I picked up a lot more understanding of how things work, and how they are connected to one another, and could become a person that I can be kind of proud of. But there are fewer and less exciting topics that I find and probably it has to do about me, that honestly I became a bit lazy and do not feel as much excitement as in the past about my job. Sure, it’s awesome to see a lot of the camo-wrapped cars running around and having some discussion with the customers and seeing that they actually care about the final product. But I feel like something has to change.

Why did I say that leaving the university might bight me in the back later? Currently, I’m stuck as an SW Technician as my official role even if I’m doing engineering and can’t progress further, because HR says that to be an Engineer you must be graduated. I complained this about a lot and hopefully, there’ll be some changes to it in the future, but don’t know yet. Why does it hurt? Cause I’m being contacted on Linkedin by multiple recruitment agencies for engineering positions due to my years of experience. It’s charming but I feel comfortable at my place for now, and I hope that it stays that way.

But as a finishing paragraph, I do enjoy mountain biking a lot too, although didn’t spend as much time with it this year as I wanted to but I’m going to change it for the better for next year. To give you a slight overview kind reader here’s one of my videos about the place where I like to hang out.
