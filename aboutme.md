<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
Currently I work at <strong>Continental Automotive Hungary</strong> as a Sr. Software Engineer coding in C, on various projects. Previously I worked at many places mainly out of the scope of technology, where I got to learn the value of "white-collar" jobs.

<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
I'm mostly a self-taugh developer, as from the times I was a little child I was always excited about it, and looked into things how they work. I did start University studies after middle school, but due to never having a proper teacher previously I didn't feel like I was learning anything there, so I left it.

I love tinkering around with my homelab stuff, or just making smaller projects for friends in Python, C, C++, CSS, and JavaScript.

I grew up in Veszprem, Hungary and mostly attended the local schools around and never really been outside of the country for extended periods of time. Currently I live in Hajmasker, Hungary which I immensely enjoy cause itâ€™s hushed around here.
