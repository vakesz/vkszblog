I’m Gabor "vakesz" Pinkova. Currently, I work at Continental Automotive as a Software Engineer coding in C, on various projects. But I like doing multiple other different things in my free time. Also, I live in Hungary in a small village, which I immensely enjoy cause it’s hushed around here.
 - MTB riding
 - Making videos
 - Making photos
 - Writing short poems
